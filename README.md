# ML Algorithm and Model Extractor

This repository provides a framework for extracting and classifying machine learning (ML) algorithms and models mentioned in research papers. The project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)** techniques to process unstructured text and produce structured outputs.

## Features

- **Automatic Algorithm Classification**: Extracts and categorizes ML algorithms (e.g., supervised, unsupervised).
- **Model Identification**: Detects specific ML model families like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
- **Customizable Output**: Outputs cleaned and formatted results in an organized structure.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular design to extend and integrate new functionalities.
